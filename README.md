# ClockScreenSaver

A neumorphism clock with random sentences.

(There is another version with frosted glass effects & random beautiful wallpapers, see the [wallpaper]() branch)

It is built as a screen saver which works with the amazing [mac WebviewScreenSaver](https://github.com/agologan/webviewscreensaver).
